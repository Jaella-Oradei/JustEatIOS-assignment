# what I would add:
1. If the restaurants could be more than just 10, It would have made sense that the restaurants be printed based on rating. So I would add a mode if the users wanted it be printed out based on rating ranking or in alphabetical order.
2. I would have also added that the text files of the restaurant lists be opened at specific size. 
3. I would also add the the outputs were filtered in only returning restaurants with the fist part of postcode and then filtering out to other postcodes so the results will be based on proximity but this is only possible with more retured restaurants.
