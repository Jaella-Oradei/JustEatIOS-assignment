# JustEatIOS-assignment
A console application that outputs the first 10 restaurants(name) it finds with 3 attached attributes (cuisine, rating &amp; address) from a given API.

# How to run:
    > Make sure you have the latest version of swift installed 
    > Clone the repository at: 
        > git clone https://github.com/Jaella-Oradei/JustEatIOS-assignment.git
    > run the main.swift in terminal
        > swiftc main.swift > ./main.swift
    > The restaurant finder program should run and output
    
    
# when done running:
    - close program at: 
        > control key with letter c
            > if the system stops working or gives an error message and run again.
    - When you have chosen to stop searching for restaurants with different postcodes, close terminal by pressing:
        > control key with letter c
        
        
# more information: 
    > Please when you open the .txt file, make sure you open it fully or half of your screen for the best view of the file.
    > console is a view of what the .txt file is going to look like.

# what I would add:
1. If the restaurants could be more than just 10, It would have made sense that the restaurants be printed based on rating. So I would add a mode if the users wanted it be printed out based on rating ranking or in alphabetical order.

2. I would have also added that the text files of the restaurant lists be opened at specific size. 

3. I would also add the the outputs were filtered in only returning restaurants with the fist part of postcode and then filtering out to other postcodes so the results will be based on proximity but this is only possible with more retured restaurants.
